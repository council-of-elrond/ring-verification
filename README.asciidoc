= ring-verification =

Use the `is-this-that-one-ring.sh` script to verify the identity of the `One Ring`, if ever you find yourself wondering if the ring you have is that one.

```bash
./is-this-that-one-ring.sh that-one-ring
Yes.
./is-this-that-one-ring.sh a-different-ring
No.
```

== Alternative Method ==

It has been reported that if you heat the ring, such as by throwing it in
a fire, the following text can be discerned on it:

```
Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul
```

Note: If you have the One Ring, and you reveal the above text, please be sure
not to read it aloud in the tongue of Mordor.
